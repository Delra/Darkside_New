# Darkside_New
This is the shadow-side version of Sunder. Sunder itself is open source and designed for Aetolia, though it could likely be implemented for any IRE MUD.

This GitHub was started to make it easier for people to contribute updates that they feel will help the system, be that in optimization or otherwise.
